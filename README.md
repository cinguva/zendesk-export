# zendesk-export
## What is it?
A super simple Node application which downloads a complete copy of Zendesk data as JSON using their REST API.

## Why?
We needed to cancel Zendesk, but wanted to retain a copy of their database. CSV exports were determined insufficient as it would break relational data; we wanted something we could potentially import again into another database and/or manipulate/search.
